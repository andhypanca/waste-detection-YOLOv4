# waste-detection-YOLOv4

Real-time Waste Detection to solve waste sorting problem. 

This research is using deep learning algorithm for object detection that have 4 classes (glass, metal, paper, and plastic).  

This model can show the bounding box, class, and prediction probability of objects in each image. The model can also be run using 3 different inputs such as images, videos, and a webcam.
